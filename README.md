# Hello-World

Hello everyone! 
This is the GitHub and it would be wise to accustom yourself to it since we'll be using this platform often.  
Please don't create ridiculous repositories. Kittens will die if you do this heinous act.

Hack Club is going to be an engaging and exciting club to be in, but it does require work in understanding the curriculum given as well as participating in the actual club.  
Have fun!
